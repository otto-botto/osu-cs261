Purpose
The purpose of this introductory assignment is to get to know more about yourself and your programming experience so far and check your system to make sure you have all the needed tools to complete the assignments in this course. This assignment is weighted much lower than the typical assignment weight.

Part 1: Introduction and Programming Experience
At first, introduce yourself on Ed Discussion using this thread (A0: Introduction Links to an external site.).

Then, write a one-paragraph double-spaced essay in the programming_experience.txt file in which you describe your programming experience by answering the following questions, and submit it on Canvas: 

    • What programming languages do you know?
    • How many years of experience do you have with each?
    • For each language, which IDEs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment Links to an external site.) have you used?
    • What programming-related classes have you taken?

NOTE:  The content of the Ed Discussion post and the essay you're uploading are different.  Write a unique post for each.
